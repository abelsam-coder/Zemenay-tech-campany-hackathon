i built a social media platofrm for this project i use 5 programming language

# 1,html for web structure
# 2,css for style
# 3,js/javascript for responsiveness
# 4,python (framework flask) for backend
# 5,sqlite for database

. when you open the page first the api check whether you are in session if you are in session 
it redirect to dashboard / admin panel if not it redirect to login page it ensure privacy.

in frontend i was trying to build user friendly web do i use best typography,color,animation, and layout as much
as possible in 

# signup page:

when you open signup api there is 3 form a user need to fill username, email , password if the username is 
taken by another user it flash the message "username is taken by another user"  and also there is one hidden 
form that is device detection form to detect and store which device is trying to register and the device name
gonna stored in a a database.

if a user put the correct credential the system put username into session and redirect to dashboard / admin panel

html page (signup.html)
backend (signup.py)
# signup main page

# login page:

this page has 2 form username ,password the system allow only 5 attempt to make secure and protect from 
brute force cyber attack (it is a popular cyber attack to gain access of another device "means trying many attempt
until you get the correct much
")  

after 5 try the system disable the form and just count 5 minute after 5 minute the system just allow
the form when a user fill incorrect credential show a pop up flash animation if a user fill correct credential
the system put username in to session and redirect to dashboard / admin panel

# in logout system

 it just session.pop means out from session and redirect to login page

# setting / configration page:

this page is just to configure setting like content privacy,like , comment, and security risk

content privacy means it just show content for whom the user follow.
like and comment means hide and show the number of like and comment respectively
security risk means as i told you before when you sign and login the system detect the device platform name 
after that when you try to login the system much the platform name from the previus signup if not much it show 
a user and device platform in security risk page


it actually take much time this page has 5 main folder

1,backend
2,database
3,documentation
4,static
5,template

overall it has around 14 table in a database
as an individual competitor i try to do as much as i can i will try to make better code structer for another 
time thanks you all
